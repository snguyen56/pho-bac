              <p>
                Pho Bac, established in 1997, is now one of the most famous
                trade names known in Atlanta, Georgia. During the past 24 years,
                our restaurant in Chamblee ceaselessly improves and serves
                millions of delicious pho bowls to the guests. We are operating
                as a family heirloom and family-owned pho restaurant, which
                provides our distinguished guests with a cozy and intimate
                space. In order to expand our activity and serve more guests in
                different regions, Pho Bac has recently set up its new division
                in Duluth, Georgia. With our family heirloom formula from 12
                kinds of herbs for a natural, tasty pho bowl, it is believed
                that Pho Bac will satisfy even the most gastronomic guests.
